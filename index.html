                <p>The Rhodes piano (also known as the Fender Rhodes piano) 
                    is an electric piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became 
                    popular in the 1970s. Like a conventional piano, the Rhodes generates 
                    sound with keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin 
                    metal tines, which vibrate next to an electromagnetic pickup. The signal is then 
                    sent through a cable to an external keyboard amplifier and speaker.</p>

                <p>The Wurlitzer electronic piano is an electric piano manufactured and marketed
                     by Wurlitzer from 1954 to 1983. Sound is generated by striking a metal reed
                      with a hammer, which induces an electric current in a pickup. It is conceptually
                       similar to the Rhodes piano, though the sound is different.</p>

                <p>The Clavinet is an electrically amplified clavichord invented 
                    by Ernst Zacharias and manufactured by the Hohner company of Trossingen, 
                    West Germany, from 1964 to 1982. The instrument produces sounds with rubber 
                    pads, each matching one of the keys and responding to a keystroke by striking 
                    a given point on a tensioned string, and was designed to resemble the Renaissance-era clavichord.</p>
